Rubenstein says that Emperor Constantine and his advisor Hosius of Corduba were aware of the usefulness of having a divinely ordained church in which the church authority, and not the individual, was able to determine individual salvation, and threw their support toward the homoousion Nicene formula.[79] According to Eusebius, Constantine suggested the term homoousios at the Council of Nicaea, though most scholars have doubted that Constantine had such knowledge and have thought that most likely Hosius had suggested the term to him.[80] Constantine later changed his view about the Arians, who opposed the Nicene formula, and supported the bishops who rejected the formula,[81] as did several of his successors, the first emperor to be baptized in the Nicene faith being Theodosius the Great, emperor from 379 to 395.[82]\tchristianity\n22\tList of state economies\tfinance\nprintln(\"Rows where 'userFeatures' is not the right size are filtered out\")\tmachine-learning\n  .load(\"data/mllib/sample_multiclass_classification_data.txt\")\tmachine-learning\nPhilip Schaff commenting on Irenaeus, wrote, 'This censure of images as a Gnostic peculiarity, and as a heathenish corruption, should be noted'.

Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.\tmachine-learning\nIf the prediction input is lower or higher than all training features then prediction with lowest or highest feature is returned respectively.

Paul and the Apostles traveled extensively throughout the Empire, including Asia Minor, establishing Churches in major communities, with the first Churches appearing in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries later would become prominent as the New Rome.[158] Christianity in the Roman Empire met with considerable resistance, as its adherents would refuse to comply with the Roman state (even at the threat of death) in offering sacrifice to the pagan gods. Despite persecutions, the Church spread. The persecution dissipated upon the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in 324 AD.[158]\tchristianity\nMcManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 91f.\tchristianity\nScala\tmachine-learning\n  (1L, \"b d\", 0.0),\tmachine-learning\nOnce established as Holy Scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study,[109] even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the \"Anagignoskomena\" (ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, \"things that are read\") comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon,[110] but deemed by the Eastern Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon.[111] The lowest tier contains the remaining books not accepted by either Protestants or Roman Catholics, among them, Psalm 151. Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter (the first 150 psalms),[112] and hence does not participate in the various liturgical and prayer uses of the Psalter.\tchristianity\nIn Christianity, Jerusalem is sometimes interpreted as an allegory or type for the Church of Christ. There is a vast apocalyptic tradition that focuses on the heavenly Jerusalem instead of the literal and historical city of Jerusalem. Christians have not controlled the actual city of Jerusalem since the time of the Crusades (except for a brief period in the immediate aftermath of the 1917 Battle of Jerusalem) and have mostly relied on biblical symbols and metaphors that describe the Church as if it were the true living Jerusalem. This view is notably advocated in Augustine's City of God, a popular 5th-century Christian book that was written during the fall of the Western Roman Empire.\tchristianity\nAnticipating a slump in domestic military and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[190] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.[191][192]\tspace\nEach instance of a Transformer or Estimator has a unique ID, which is useful in specifying parameters (discussed below).\tmachine-learning\nParameters belong to specific instances of Estimators and Transformers. For example, if we have two LogisticRegression instances lr1 and lr2, then we can build a ParamMap with both maxIter parameters specified: ParamMap(lr1.maxIter -> 10, lr2.maxIter -> 20). This is useful if there are two algorithms with the maxIter parameter in a Pipeline.\tmachine-learning\nVenture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, which it still dominates.[355] According to the National Venture Capital Association 11% of private sector jobs come from venture capital backed companies and venture capital backed revenue accounts for 21% of U.S. GDP.[356]\tfinance\nIt is common in many real-world use cases to only have access to implicit feedback (e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.). The approach used in spark.ml to deal with such data is taken from Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets. Essentially, instead of trying to model the matrix of ratings directly, this approach treats the data as numbers representing the strength in observations of user actions (such as the number of clicks, or the cumulative duration someone spent viewing a movie). Those numbers are then related to the level of confidence in observed user preferences, rather than explicit ratings given to items. The model then tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.\tmachine-learning\nIn 2013, U.S. exports goods and services amounted to $2.27 trillion and imports goods and services amounted to $2.74 trillion, with a trade deficit was $450 billion.[282] The deficit on petroleum products was $232 billion.

They consist to a large degree of litanies asking for God's mercy on the living and the dead, readings from the Psalter with introductory prayers, troparia, and other prayers and hymns surrounding them. The Psalms are so arranged that when all the services are celebrated the entire Psalter is read through in their course once a week, and twice a week during Great Lent when the services are celebrated in an extended form.\tchristianity\nIn the Synoptics, Jesus and his disciples go to the garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to identify him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.[193][135][191]\tchristianity\nAs of 2010 The U.S. had the fourth-widest income distribution among OECD nations, behind Turkey, Mexico, and Chile.[165][166][167] The Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income inequality was increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing social mobility in the US.[168] The OECD ranks the U.S. 10th in social mobility, behind the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and France.[169] Of the major developed nations, only Italy and Great Britain have lower mobility.[170] This has been partly attributed to the depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children economically disadvantaged,[171] though others have observed that a relative rise in the U.S. is mathematically harder due to its higher and more widely distributed income range than in nations with artificial income compression, even if one enjoys more absolute mobility in the U.S., and have questioned how meaningful such international comparisons are.[172]\tfinance\nIn production, for new users or items that have no rating history and on which the model has not been trained (this is the “cold start problem”).\tmachine-learning\nMD, Scott W.

The Church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is.[114] Christ promised: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth\".[115] The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the Church to the interpretation of Scripture. The Church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in imitation of Christ, achieving theosis, can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Individual interpretation occurs within the Church and is informed by the Church. It is rational and reasoned, but is not arrived at only by means of deductive reasoning.\tchristianity\n\"Twin deficit\" (1960–2006)\tfinance\nAn investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested, whereas in saving (such as in a bank deposit) the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote.

As Saint Basil famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype.

It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many Catholic clergy;[337] Jesuits in particular,[338][339] have been active in the sciences throughout history and have made significant contributions to the development of science.[340] Protestantism also has had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.[341] The Civilizing influence of Christianity includes social welfare,[342] founding hospitals,[343] economics (as the Protestant work ethic),[344][345] politics,[346] architecture,[347] literature,[348] personal hygiene,[349][350] and family life.[351]\tchristianity\nAnother major facility is Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed.[148] The JPL worked together with ABMA, one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first American space mission.\tspace\nCompton, William David (1989).

The word \"apologetic\" comes from the Greek word \"apologeomai\", meaning \"in defense of\". Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher Thomas Aquinas presented five arguments for God's existence in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles was a major apologetic work.[393][394] Another famous apologist, G. K. Chesterton, wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.[395][396] He pointed to the advance of Christian civilizations as proof of its practicality.[397] The physicist and priest John Polkinghorne, in his Questions of Truth discusses the subject of religion and science, a topic that other Christian apologists such as Ravi Zacharias, John Lennox and William Lane Craig have engaged, with the latter two men opining that the inflationary Big Bang model is evidence for the existence of God.[398]\tchristianity\n\"The National Aeronautics and Space Act\".

This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-era saints Cyril and Methodius. When king Rastislav of Moravia asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose these two brothers. Cyril and Methodius translated the Bible and many of the prayer books. As the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language Old Church Slavonic was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of Great Moravia, Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with Frankish missionaries from the Roman diocese.

The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10 ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\tspace\nSeamans' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision.[36] This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.[37] The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.[38]\tspace\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin.

The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles.[279][280] Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).[281]\tchristianity"},{"type":"TEXT","data":"Output exceeds 102400.

Rubenstein says that Emperor Constantine and his advisor Hosius of Corduba were aware of the usefulness of having a divinely ordained church in which the church authority, and not the individual, was able to determine individual salvation, and threw their support toward the homoousion Nicene formula.[79] According to Eusebius, Constantine suggested the term homoousios at the Council of Nicaea, though most scholars have doubted that Constantine had such knowledge and have thought that most likely Hosius had suggested the term to him.[80] Constantine later changed his view about the Arians, who opposed the Nicene formula, and supported the bishops who rejected the formula,[81] as did several of his successors, the first emperor to be baptized in the Nicene faith being Theodosius the Great, emperor from 379 to 395.[82]\tchristianity\t1.0\n22\tList of state economies\tfinance\t3.0\nprintln(\"Rows where 'userFeatures' is not the right size are filtered out\")\tmachine-learning\t0.0\n  .load(\"data/mllib/sample_multiclass_classification_data.txt\")\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nPhilip Schaff commenting on Irenaeus, wrote, 'This censure of images as a Gnostic peculiarity, and as a heathenish corruption, should be noted'.

Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nIf the prediction input is lower or higher than all training features then prediction with lowest or highest feature is returned respectively.

Paul and the Apostles traveled extensively throughout the Empire, including Asia Minor, establishing Churches in major communities, with the first Churches appearing in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries later would become prominent as the New Rome.[158] Christianity in the Roman Empire met with considerable resistance, as its adherents would refuse to comply with the Roman state (even at the threat of death) in offering sacrifice to the pagan gods. Despite persecutions, the Church spread. The persecution dissipated upon the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in 324 AD.[158]\tchristianity\t1.0\nMcManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, p. 91f.\tchristianity\t1.0\nScala\tmachine-learning\t0.0\n  (1L, \"b d\", 0.0),\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nOnce established as Holy Scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study,[109] even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the \"Anagignoskomena\" (ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, \"things that are read\") comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon,[110] but deemed by the Eastern Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon.[111] The lowest tier contains the remaining books not accepted by either Protestants or Roman Catholics, among them, Psalm 151. Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter (the first 150 psalms),[112] and hence does not participate in the various liturgical and prayer uses of the Psalter.\tchristianity\t1.0\nIn Christianity, Jerusalem is sometimes interpreted as an allegory or type for the Church of Christ. There is a vast apocalyptic tradition that focuses on the heavenly Jerusalem instead of the literal and historical city of Jerusalem. Christians have not controlled the actual city of Jerusalem since the time of the Crusades (except for a brief period in the immediate aftermath of the 1917 Battle of Jerusalem) and have mostly relied on biblical symbols and metaphors that describe the Church as if it were the true living Jerusalem. This view is notably advocated in Augustine's City of God, a popular 5th-century Christian book that was written during the fall of the Western Roman Empire.\tchristianity\t1.0\nAnticipating a slump in domestic military and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[190] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.[191][192]\tspace\t2.0\nEach instance of a Transformer or Estimator has a unique ID, which is useful in specifying parameters (discussed below).\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nParameters belong to specific instances of Estimators and Transformers. For example, if we have two LogisticRegression instances lr1 and lr2, then we can build a ParamMap with both maxIter parameters specified: ParamMap(lr1.maxIter -> 10, lr2.maxIter -> 20). This is useful if there are two algorithms with the maxIter parameter in a Pipeline.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nVenture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, which it still dominates.[355] According to the National Venture Capital Association 11% of private sector jobs come from venture capital backed companies and venture capital backed revenue accounts for 21% of U.S. GDP.[356]\tfinance\t3.0\nIt is common in many real-world use cases to only have access to implicit feedback (e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.). The approach used in spark.ml to deal with such data is taken from Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets. Essentially, instead of trying to model the matrix of ratings directly, this approach treats the data as numbers representing the strength in observations of user actions (such as the number of clicks, or the cumulative duration someone spent viewing a movie). Those numbers are then related to the level of confidence in observed user preferences, rather than explicit ratings given to items. The model then tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nIn 2013, U.S. exports goods and services amounted to $2.27 trillion and imports goods and services amounted to $2.74 trillion, with a trade deficit was $450 billion.[282] The deficit on petroleum products was $232 billion.

Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to identify him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.[193][135][191]\tchristianity\t1.0\nAs of 2010 The U.S. had the fourth-widest income distribution among OECD nations, behind Turkey, Mexico, and Chile.[165][166][167] The Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income inequality was increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing social mobility in the US.[168] The OECD ranks the U.S. 10th in social mobility, behind the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and France.[169] Of the major developed nations, only Italy and Great Britain have lower mobility.[170] This has been partly attributed to the depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children economically disadvantaged,[171] though others have observed that a relative rise in the U.S. is mathematically harder due to its higher and more widely distributed income range than in nations with artificial income compression, even if one enjoys more absolute mobility in the U.S., and have questioned how meaningful such international comparisons are.[172]\tfinance\t3.0\nIn production, for new users or items that have no rating history and on which the model has not been trained (this is the “cold start problem”).\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nMD, Scott W.

The Church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in imitation of Christ, achieving theosis, can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance.

In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nThis page was last edited on 27 April 2018, at 20:16.\tchristianity\t1.0\n7\tEBITDA\tfinance\t3.0\nExamples: model selection via train validation split\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nval dataFrame = spark.createDataFrame(data).toDF(\"id\", \"feature\")\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nFor each ParamMap, they fit the Estimator using those parameters, get the fitted Model, and evaluate the Model’s performance using the Evaluator.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\n3.3 |false|2        |bar   |(262144,[6031,  80619,140467,174475],[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.3])\tmachine-learning\t0.0\n\"Houston Mayor, NASA Administrator & Russian Ambassador Dedicate Gifts of Artworks Honoring Russian and US Space Pioneers\".

Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph of a loved one. As Saint Basil famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.\tchristianity\t1.0\nOtt, Ludwig.

It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many Catholic clergy;[337] Jesuits in particular,[338][339] have been active in the sciences throughout history and have made significant contributions to the development of science.[340] Protestantism also has had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.[341] The Civilizing influence of Christianity includes social welfare,[342] founding hospitals,[343] economics (as the Protestant work ethic),[344][345] politics,[346] architecture,[347] literature,[348] personal hygiene,[349][350] and family life.[351]\tchristianity\t1.0\nAnother major facility is Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed.[148] The JPL worked together with ABMA, one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first American space mission.\tspace\t2.0\nCompton, William David (1989).

The word \"apologetic\" comes from the Greek word \"apologeomai\", meaning \"in defense of\". Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher Thomas Aquinas presented five arguments for God's existence in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles was a major apologetic work.[393][394] Another famous apologist, G. K. Chesterton, wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.[395][396] He pointed to the advance of Christian civilizations as proof of its practicality.[397] The physicist and priest John Polkinghorne, in his Questions of Truth discusses the subject of religion and science, a topic that other Christian apologists such as Ravi Zacharias, John Lennox and William Lane Craig have engaged, with the latter two men opining that the inflationary Big Bang model is evidence for the existence of God.[398]\tchristianity\t1.0\n\"The National Aeronautics and Space Act\".

Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus.[427][428] The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics[429][430][431] and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.[432][433]\tchristianity\t1.0\n1.1\tCreeds\tchristianity\t1.0\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nBeyond Low Earth Orbit program (2010–2017)\tspace\t2.0\nNotable companies and markets\tfinance\t3.0\nGini coefficient\tfinance\t3.0\nFind full example code at \"examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml/PCAExample.scala\" in the Spark repo.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nThe Confession of the Council of Nicaea said little about the Holy Spirit.[50] The doctrine of the divinity and personality of the Holy Spirit was developed by Athanasius in the last decades of his life.[51] He defended and refined the Nicene formula.[50] By the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine had reached substantially its current form.[50]\tchristianity\t1.0\nMultimedia\tspace\t2.0\n)).toDF(\"id\", \"text\", \"label\")\tmachine-learning\t0.0\n3.3\tOne God as Three Persons\tchristianity\t1.0\nPolarized conclusions regarding the Shroud of Turin remain.[442] According to former Nature editor Philip Ball, \"it's fair to say that, despite the seemingly definitive tests in 1988, the status of the Shroud of Turin is murkier than ever.

This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-era saints Cyril and Methodius. When king Rastislav of Moravia asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose these two brothers. Cyril and Methodius translated the Bible and many of the prayer books. As the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language Old Church Slavonic was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of Great Moravia, Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with Frankish missionaries from the Roman diocese.

Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.[37] The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.[38]\tspace\t2.0\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin.

There is a vast apocalyptic tradition that focuses on the heavenly Jerusalem instead of the literal and historical city of Jerusalem. Christians have not controlled the actual city of Jerusalem since the time of the Crusades (except for a brief period in the immediate aftermath of the 1917 Battle of Jerusalem) and have mostly relied on biblical symbols and metaphors that describe the Church as if it were the true living Jerusalem.

The approach used in spark.ml to deal with such data is taken from Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets. Essentially, instead of trying to model the matrix of ratings directly, this approach treats the data as numbers representing the strength in observations of user actions (such as the number of clicks, or the cumulative duration someone spent viewing a movie). Those numbers are then related to the level of confidence in observed user preferences, rather than explicit ratings given to items.

The Church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is.[114] Christ promised: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth\".[115] The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the Church to the interpretation of Scripture.

Jesus Christ's Great Commission to the apostles, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire. Paul and the Apostles traveled extensively throughout the Empire, including Asia Minor, establishing Churches in major communities, with the first Churches appearing in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries later would become prominent as the New Rome.[158] Christianity in the Roman Empire met with considerable resistance, as its adherents would refuse to comply with the Roman state (even at the threat of death) in offering sacrifice to the pagan gods. Despite persecutions, the Church spread. The persecution dissipated upon the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in 324 AD.[158]\tchristianity\t1.0\tWrappedArray(following, jesus, christ, s, great, commission, to, the, apostles,

of 2010 The U.S. had the fourth-widest income distribution among OECD nations, behind Turkey, Mexico, and Chile.[165][166][167] The Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income inequality was increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing social mobility in the US.[168] The OECD ranks the U.S. 10th in social mobility, behind the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and France.[169] Of the major developed nations, only Italy and Great Britain have lower mobility.[170] This has been partly attributed to the depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children economically disadvantaged,[171] though others have observed that a relative rise in the U.S. is mathematically harder due to its higher and more widely distributed income range than in nations with artificial income compression, even if one enjoys more absolute mobility in the U.S., and have questioned how meaningful such international comparisons are.[172]\tfinance\t3.0\tWrappedArray(as, of,
