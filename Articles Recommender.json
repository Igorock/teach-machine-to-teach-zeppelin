The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\tmusic\nAn Estimator abstracts the concept of a learning algorithm or any algorithm that fits or trains on data. Technically, an Estimator implements a method fit(), which accepts a DataFrame and produces a Model, which is a Transformer. For example, a learning algorithm such as LogisticRegression is an Estimator, and calling fit() trains a LogisticRegressionModel, which is a Model and hence a Transformer.\tmachine-learning\nPartly, he says, it's quite a deliberate response to previous depressive tendencies. He armed himself against any midlife despair, he says, with a three-point plan: \"Running, yoga, meditation.\" He wouldn't exactly describe himself as centred yet, he says, but he tries. While working on King of Limbs he took himself off into the park early every morning, sat on a bench for an hour. \"It was important at the time,\" he says. \"I wanted to be properly open-minded about what would happen in the studio.\" He suggests that approach might be a different kind of politics for him – \"Just being looser in your thinking allows you to avoid fixed ideas.\" It allows him to take more physical pleasure in the craft and act of singing, he says, \"how it makes you feel physically\". He has come to discover that the best things that happen musically \"are often when you're super-unsure and kind of flailing around. You just work at it and wait.\"\tmusic\n1.2\tCorporate finance\tfinance\n20th- and 21st-century music\tmusic\nA Saturn IB rocket launches Apollo 7, 1968\tspace\nspam filter is usually passive – waiting for users to mark the e-mails coming\tmachine-learning\nFederal, state, and local government spending as a % of GDP history\tfinance\n  .setQuantileProbabilities(quantileProbabilities)\tmachine-learning\nMD, Scott W.

The \"Baby Boom\" saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years, a surge in prosperity, a demand for suburban single-family homes (as opposed to inner city apartments) and new optimism about the future. The boom crested about 1957, then slowly declined. A period of high inflation, interest rates and unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for regulating the overall pace of economic activity.\tfinance\ncenters.foreach(println)\tmachine-learning\nIncrease 40 (2017 est.)\tfinance\nhttp://www.waaytv.com/space_alabama/how-nasa-plans-to-put-boots-on-mars-using-huntsville/article_6e3453de-13c5-11e7-847e-3fe56b428c09.html\tspace\n\"Private Debt Becomes Public Debt – Room for Debate\".

The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016. SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX. After further extensions late in 2015, SpaceX is currently scheduled to fly a total of 20 missions. A second phase of contracts (known as CRS2) were solicited and proposed in 2014. They were awarded in January 2016, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024.\tspace\nSaturn I launch vehicles\t767.1 million\tspace\nMiles O'Brien (June 1, 2012). \"Elon Musk Unedited\".

Musical notation was used since Ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic church so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are Léonin, Pérotin, Guillaume de Machaut, and Walther von der Vogelweide.\tmusic\nits sound agreeable and named it huangzhong, the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard phoenixes singing.

In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \"Sputnik crisis\"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a \"Special Committee on Space Technology\", headed by Guyford Stever.

Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the \"home note\" or tonic of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\tmusic\nval evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator()\tmachine-learning\nval lrModel = lr.fit(training)\tmachine-learning\nIn 2014 NASA proposed the Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed.\tspace\nAfter the regular liquidity pushes of 2016, the Chinese government has now shifted to a tightening bias, propagating a destock cycle through the manufacturing chain.

For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings).

Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

As a result of Elon Musk's goal of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9, by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid surfaces. Once the company determined that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit out at sea as a target for the returning first stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS). SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015, and in April 2016, the first stage booster first successfully landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You.\tspace\nTFIDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d)⋅IDF(t,D).\tmachine-learning\nThe overall median income for all 155 million persons over the age of 15 who worked with earnings in 2005 was $28,567.

Facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance. Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked at or near the top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of that list for life expectancy.

A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the blues, a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze.\tmusic\nZak, Anatoly (October 15, 2008). \"Russian Segment: Enterprise\". RussianSpaceWeb.

An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the Passacaglia and Chaconne, was that of the ground bass – a repeating bass theme or basso ostinato over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning polyphonic or contrapuntal threads, or improvising divisions and descants. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form par excellence of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music.

On the flight home, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only three percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70% gross margin.\tspace\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. Romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the sonata form used in string quartets and symphonies), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter.

A good company is one that focuses on the long term value, the quality of what it offers or the share price. This company must have a durable competitive advantage, which means that it has a market position or branding which either prevents easy access by competitors or controls a scarce raw material source. Some examples of companies that response to these criteria are in the field of insurance, soft drinks, shoes, chocolates, home building, furniture and many more.

Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, 260,000 feet (80 km).\tspace\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.RegressionEvaluator\tmachine-learning\nAdvance aeronautics research\tspace\nKennedy, John F.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, polyphonic contrapuntal music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Lucio Vivaldi.\tmusic\n  .setLabelCol(\"label\")\tmachine-learning\nWhat is “Spark ML”?\tmachine-learning\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used.

Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\tmusic\t3.0\nAn Estimator abstracts the concept of a learning algorithm or any algorithm that fits or trains on data.

The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016. SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX. After further extensions late in 2015, SpaceX is currently scheduled to fly a total of 20 missions. A second phase of contracts (known as CRS2) were solicited and proposed in 2014.

The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs).

In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \"Sputnik crisis\"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a \"Special Committee on Space Technology\", headed by Guyford Stever. On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published \"A National Research Program for Space Technology\" stating:\tspace\t1.0\nProperties of pipeline components\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nAssyrians playing zurna and Davul, instruments that go back thousands of years.\tmusic\t3.0\nHarmony refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a chord. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the \"home note\" or tonic of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\tmusic\t3.0\nval evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator()\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nval lrModel = lr.fit(training)\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nIn 2014 NASA proposed the Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed.\tspace\t1.0\nAfter the regular liquidity pushes of 2016, the Chinese government has now shifted to a tightening bias, propagating a destock cycle through the manufacturing chain.

For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).\tmusic\t3.0\n 3  | a\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nAmy Svitak (February 11, 2014). \"Arianespace To ESA: We Need Help\".

For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when danger of recession appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

Facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance. Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked at or near the top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country, though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that age in peer nations.\tfinance\t2.0\nWernher von Braun proposal (1947 through 1950s)\tspace\t1.0\nForm or structure\tmusic\t3.0\nFind full example code at \"examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml/KMeansExample.scala\" in the Spark repo.\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nto them.

A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the blues, a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze.\tmusic\t3.0\nZak, Anatoly (October 15, 2008). \"Russian Segment: Enterprise\". RussianSpaceWeb.

An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the Passacaglia and Chaconne, was that of the ground bass – a repeating bass theme or basso ostinato over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning polyphonic or contrapuntal threads, or improvising divisions and descants. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form par excellence of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music.

Musk tried to buy cheap rockets from Russia but returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price. On the flight home, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only three percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70% gross margin.\tspace\t1.0\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. Romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the sonata form used in string quartets and symphonies), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter.

In time of economic decline, there are many opportunities to buy good shares at reasonable prices. But, what makes a company good for shareholders? A good company is one that focuses on the long term value, the quality of what it offers or the share price. This company must have a durable competitive advantage, which means that it has a market position or branding which either prevents easy access by competitors or controls a scarce raw material source. Some examples of companies that response to these criteria are in the field of insurance, soft drinks, shoes, chocolates, home building, furniture and many more.

This was followed by a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, 260,000 feet (80 km).\tspace\t1.0\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.RegressionEvaluator\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nAdvance aeronautics research\tspace\t1.0\nKennedy, John F.

Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, polyphonic contrapuntal music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Lucio Vivaldi.\tmusic\t3.0\n  .setLabelCol(\"label\")\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nWhat is “Spark ML”?\tmachine-learning\t0.0\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used.

Recent, mild recessions have included the 1990–91 downturn, when output fell by 1.3%, and the 2001 recession, in which GDP slid by 0.3%; the 2001 downturn lasted just eight months. The most vigorous, sustained periods of growth, on the other hand, took place from early 1961 to mid-1969, with an expansion of 53% (5.1% a year), from mid-1991 to late in 2000, at 43% (3.8% a year), and from late 1982 to mid-1990, at 37% (4% a year).\tfinance\t2.0\nNow that the connection between public and private debt is better-known, U.S. combined debts are worrisome.

The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.

In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \"Sputnik crisis\"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a \"Special Committee on Space Technology\", headed by Guyford Stever.

Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the \"home note\" or tonic of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\tmusic\t3.0\tWrappedArray(harmony, refers, to, the, vertical, sounds, of, pitches, in, music, which, means, pitches, that, are, played, or, sung, together, at, the, same, time, to, create, a, chord, usually, this, means, the, notes, are, played, at, the, same, time, although, harmony, may, also, be, implied, by, a, melody, that, outlines, a, harmonic, structure, i, e, by, using, melody, notes, that, are, played, one, after, the, other, outlining, the, notes, of, a, chord, in, music, written, using, the, system, of, major, minor, tonality, keys, which, includes, most, classical, music, written, from, 1600, to, 1900, and, most, western, pop, rock, and, traditional, music, the, key, of, a, piece, determines, the, scale, used, which, centres, around, the, home, note, or, tonic, of, the, key, simple, classical, pieces, and, many, pop, and, traditional, music, songs, are, written, so, that, all, the, music, is, in, a, single, key, more, complex, classical, pop, and, traditional, music, songs, and, pieces, may, have, two, keys, and, in, some, cases, three, or, more, keys, classical, music, from, the, romantic, era, written, from, about, 1820, 1900, often, contains, multiple, keys, as, does, jazz, especially, bebop, jazz, from, the, 1940s, in, which, the, key, or, home, note, of, a, song, may, change, every, four, bars, or, even, every, two, bars)\nval evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator()\tmachine-learning\t0.0\tWrappedArray(val, evaluator, new, multiclassclassificationevaluator)\nval lrModel = lr.fit(training)\tmachine-learning\t0.0\tWrappedArray(val, lrmodel, lr, fit, training)\nIn 2014 NASA proposed the Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed.\tspace\t1.0\tWrappedArray(in, 2014, nasa, proposed, the, mars, ecopoiesis, test, bed)\nAfter the regular liquidity pushes of 2016, the Chinese government has now shifted to a tightening bias, propagating a destock cycle through the manufacturing chain.

The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\tmusic\t3.0\tWrappedArray(deep, purple, have, had, several, line, up, changes, and, an, eight, year, hiatus, 1976, 1984, the, 1968, 1976, line, ups, are, commonly, labelled, mark, i, ii, iii, and, iv, their, second, and, most, commercially, successful, line, up, consisted, of, ian, gillan, vocals, jon, lord, keyboards, backing, vocals, roger, glover, bass, ian, paice, drums, and, ritchie, blackmore, guitar, this, line, up, was, active, from, 1969, to, 1973, and, was, revived, from, 1984, to, 1989, and, again, from, 1992, to, 1993, the, band, achieved, more, modest, success, in, the, intervening, periods, between, 1968, and, 1969, with, the, line, up, including, rod, evans, lead, vocals, and, nick, simper, bass, backing, vocals, between, 1974, and, 1976, tommy, bolin, replacing, blackmore, in, 1975, with, the, line, up, including, david, coverdale, lead, vocals, and, glenn, hughes, bass, vocals, and, between, 1989, and, 1992, with, the, line, up, including, joe, lynn, turner, vocals, the, band, s, line, up, currently, including, ian, gillan, and, guitarist, steve, morse, from, 1994, has, been, much, more, stable, in, recent, years, although, keyboardist, jon, lord, s, retirement, from, the, band, in, 2002, being, succeeded, by, don, airey, left, ian, paice, as, the, only, original, deep, purple, member, still, in, the, band)\tWrappedArray(deep, purple, several, line, changes, eight, year, hiatus, 1976, 1984, 1968, 1976, line, ups, commonly, labelled, mark, ii, iii, iv, second, commercially, successful, line, consisted, ian, gillan, vocals, jon, lord, keyboards, backing, vocals, roger, glover, bass, ian, paice, drums, ritchie, blackmore, guitar, line, active, 1969, 1973, revived, 1984, 1989, 1992, 1993, band, achieved, modest, success, intervening, periods, 1968, 1969, line, including, rod, evans, lead, vocals, nick, simper, bass, backing, vocals, 1974, 1976, tommy, bolin, replacing, blackmore, 1975, line, including, david, coverdale, lead, vocals, glenn, hughes, bass, vocals, 1989, 1992, line, including, joe, lynn, turner, vocals, band, line, currently, including, ian, gillan, guitarist, steve, morse, 1994, much, stable, recent, years, although, keyboardist, jon, lord, retirement, band, 2002, succeeded, airey, left, ian, paice, original, deep, purple, member, still, band)\nAn Estimator abstracts the concept of a learning algorithm or any algorithm that fits or trains on data.

The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016. SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX. After further extensions late in 2015, SpaceX is currently scheduled to fly a total of 20 missions. A second phase of contracts (known as CRS2) were solicited and proposed in 2014.

Musical notation was used since Ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic church so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs).

In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \"Sputnik crisis\"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a \"Special Committee on Space Technology\", headed by Guyford Stever.

The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\tmusic\t3.0\tWrappedArray(deep, purple, have, had, several, line, up, changes, and, an, eight, year, hiatus, 1976, 1984, the, 1968, 1976, line, ups, are, commonly, labelled, mark, i, ii, iii, and, iv, their, second, and, most, commercially, successful, line, up, consisted, of, ian, gillan, vocals, jon, lord, keyboards, backing, vocals, roger, glover, bass, ian, paice, drums, and, ritchie, blackmore, guitar, this, line, up, was, active, from, 1969, to, 1973, and, was, revived, from, 1984, to, 1989, and, again, from, 1992, to, 1993, the, band, achieved, more, modest, success, in, the, intervening, periods, between, 1968, and, 1969, with, the, line, up, including, rod, evans, lead, vocals, and, nick, simper, bass, backing, vocals, between, 1974, and, 1976, tommy, bolin, replacing, blackmore, in, 1975, with, the, line, up, including, david, coverdale, lead, vocals, and, glenn, hughes, bass, vocals, and, between, 1989, and, 1992, with, the, line, up, including, joe, lynn, turner, vocals, the, band, s, line, up, currently, including, ian, gillan, and, guitarist, steve, morse, from, 1994, has, been, much, more, stable, in, recent, years, although, keyboardist, jon, lord, s, retirement, from, the, band, in, 2002, being, succeeded, by, don, airey, left, ian, paice, as, the, only, original, deep, purple, member, still, in, the, band)\tWrappedArray(deep, purple, several, line, changes, eight, year, hiatus, 1976, 1984, 1968, 1976, line, ups, commonly, labelled, mark, ii, iii, iv, second, commercially, successful, line, consisted, ian, gillan, vocals, jon, lord, keyboards, backing, vocals, roger, glover, bass, ian, paice, drums, ritchie, blackmore, guitar, line, active, 1969, 1973, revived, 1984, 1989, 1992, 1993, band, achieved, modest, success, intervening, periods, 1968, 1969, line, including, rod, evans, lead, vocals, nick, simper, bass, backing, vocals, 1974, 1976, tommy, bolin, replacing, blackmore, 1975, line, including, david, coverdale, lead, vocals, glenn, hughes, bass, vocals, 1989, 1992, line, including, joe, lynn, turner, vocals, band, line, currently, including, ian, gillan, guitarist, steve, morse, 1994, much, stable, recent, years, although, keyboardist, jon, lord, retirement, band, 2002, succeeded, airey, left, ian, paice, original, deep, purple, member, still, band)\t(2048,[67,76,131,133,142,147,153,174,182,185,207,229,280,284,296,340,378,380,381,398,430,438,488,515,531,541,558,578,629,645,654,682,716,745,750,819,879,883,890,908,912,953,977,983,988,993,1013,1036,1055,1057,1103,1109,1119,1122,1157,1161,1164,1171,1258,1277,1325,1328,1384,1388,1412,1472,1490,1505,1534,1549,1596,1617,1630,1653,1668,1707,1712,1747,1763,1768,1797,1806,1830,1880,1947],[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0])\nAn Estimator abstracts the concept of a learning algorithm or any algorithm that fits or trains on data.

He armed himself against any midlife despair, he says, with a three-point plan: \"Running, yoga, meditation.\" He wouldn't exactly describe himself as centred yet, he says, but he tries.

The indices are in [0, numLabels), ordered by label frequencies, so the most frequent label gets index 0. The unseen labels will be put at index numLabels if user chooses to keep them.

Musical notation was used since Ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic church so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.

or trains on data. Technically, an Estimator implements a method fit(), which accepts a DataFrame and produces a Model, which is a Transformer. For example, a learning algorithm such as LogisticRegression is an Estimator, and calling fit() trains a LogisticRegressionModel, which is a Model and hence a Transformer.\tmachine-learning\tmachine-learning\t[0.9450685932147823,0.026661404132833827,0.009736561703928014,0.0185334409484559]\nFederal tax\tfinance\tmachine-learning\t[0.39816007074335513,0.21069873640470033,0.2407400280507839,0.15040116480116067]\n 3.3|false|        2|   bar\tmachine-learning\tmachine-learning\t[0.5025155070651659,0.18748956734066952,0.18002738224281867,0.1299675433513459]\n12\tLaw and government\tfinance\tmachine-learning\t[0.42335235976906455,0.21162776008878945,0.20505875281180816,0.15996112733033788]\nHe does, with caveats. \"Well,\" he says, \"when I originally wrote that 'No more going to the dark side' line, it was kind of taking the piss.

For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings).

For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when danger of recession appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.

In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population reported not carrying health insurance to the U.S. Census. Of that number 18.3 million had annual household incomes at or greater than $50,000, 9.5 million had household incomes of $75,000 or higher, 16.2 million had household incomes of less than $25,000, 27.2 million were under age 35, and 9.7 million were non-citizens. The Census has stated that its surveys likely underreport insurance coverage. For example, a quality control analysis revealed that 16.9% of those enrolled in Medicaid incorrectly reported being uninsured. Analyses have also shown that millions of uninsured are eligible for coverage through programs like Medicaid but have not signed up or have let their enrollments expire. According to Physicians for a National Health Program, this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year. The group's methodology has been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance status changes over time, including the time of death. A 2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for.\tfinance\tfinance\t[5.64926685041325E-7,0.0032247821236774704,0.9965039279161604,2.707250334770944E-4]\nAssociation rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.\tmachine-learning\tmachine-learning\t[0.4313210850817414,0.16447168942743756,0.21958084249765464,0.1846263829931664]\nChiSqSelector\tmachine-learning\tmachine-learning\t[0.49855145358190744,0.1981931774447096,0.14085707405397838,0.1623982949194047]\nIn 2009 through 2013, following the Great Recession, the emerging problem of jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term unemployment with over 6 million workers looking for work longer than 6 months as of January 2010.

Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975.

Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W.

In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Kant. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment.
